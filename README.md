# 🏥 Patient Management System (Microservices Architecture)

A **mock production-ready Patient Management System (PMS)** built using **Java Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, **gRPC**, **Kafka**, and **Docker**, designed to demonstrate modern **microservices architecture** with AWS ECS deployment readiness.

This system replicates a real-world healthcare backend to explore backend systems, cloud-native practices, and microservices orchestration.

It follows a modular, scalable design and is currently under **active** development.
